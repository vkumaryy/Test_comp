Hi Prachi,
Good morning,

I hope this message finds you well. Unfortunately, I am feeling unwell today and will be unable to come to work.

I've been experiencing symptoms like fever and coughing, suggesting I may have the flu. My healthcare provider has advised me to undergo medical tests, including a Complete Blood Count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) test, to better understand my illness.

Given this situation, I believe I should take a day off to rest and undergo these tests. I apologize for any inconvenience caused. 

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Thanks & Regards
