Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. I am writing to formally request your approval for a short leave of absence from work on 1st to 2nd April 2024. The purpose of this leave is to undergo a scheduled medical test.

As the nature of the medical test requires timely attendance, I would be grateful for your understanding and approval of this request.

I apologize for any inconvenience my absence may cause and assure you that I will make every effort to minimize any impact on the team's operations. Prior to my leave, I will ensure that all pending tasks are either completed or appropriately delegated to ensure a smooth continuation of work in my absence.

Please let me know if you require any further information or if there are any specific procedures I need to follow regarding this leave request.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration of my request.

Best regards,
Vikash Kumar
